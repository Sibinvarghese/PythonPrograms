<b>Chennai Super Kings</b> <i>coach Stephen Fleming and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni say that the</i>
bottom-placed team will ring in the changes in its upcoming IPL matches by trying out youngsters even though the Indian is yet to notice the
requisite "spark" in them. With just three wins from 10 matches so far,
CSK now have only mathematical chances of making the play-offs. They next take on defending champions on October 23. "I think it's fair that we
will be turning that over,"
Fleming said after the seven-wicket loss to Rajasthan Royals when asked if there will be a shift from the team''s policy of sticking to a squad.
